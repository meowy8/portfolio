        <p className="">
          I&apos;m a Front-End Developer with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
          Mathematics. I love creating websites that are designed with the user
          experience in mind. Other than creating coding projects, I spend my
          free time writing, taking photos and filmmaking.
